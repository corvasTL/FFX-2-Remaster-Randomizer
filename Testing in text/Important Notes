**TO FIX**
Need to default Black Mage and White Mage's first skill to Attack.  White mage is technically safe as it not a part of a shared menu,
unlike Fire, but giving both Attack would be cool.

*MON.GET*
The monster files are 8C long
*BIG FIND*
Offset 10 -> 04: "8C" which is the length. In job.bin this same offset position is "E4" which is 228
Offset 10 -> 00 01: "21 00" for job.bin (33 job allocations). "71 01" for mon_get.bin (369 monster allocations).
